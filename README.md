# Motor Vehicle Collisions Study
Motor vehicle crash is one of the leading cause of death globally and around 1.36 epople lose their life on roadways each year in the world<sup>1</sup>. In my project, I investigated if motor vehicle collision events have any seasonal or temporal pattern and what are the possible factors that might influence the accident rate and casualty rate. Revealing the pattern and underlying factors will be an important first step to help establish effective preventive measure. It will also provide insights for auto insurance company on business problems such as the necessity of dynamic insurance payment plan. 

I acquired the dataset from NYC Open Data. This dataset contains details of crash events reported by NYPD from 2015 uptill now (last updated Feb 5, 2021). Details of the data included in the dateset can be found https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95.
